/*
ALIAS- when we present our table to the business people we should make the contents or name of the columns in our table in a more readable or business oriented form and for that purpose we are using alias.
# the keyword for this is "AS".
# the new name of the column can be put in the [] or '' .
# and if the new name is a single word it can simply put without any [] or ''.
